A few years back her son Srinath Rao got a job as a housekeeper and started helping to support the family. 

Later, Srinath got married a few years ago to Siddu Bai. They gave birth to their first beautiful daughter 4 ½ years ago!  Now Siddu is expecting again and due in early 2021. Their family was just seeing a ray of hope and Sumithra was finally able to stop working as  Srinath took over earning money to support the whole family.  Sumithra was finally able to slow down and enjoy spending time with her grandchildren. </span></p></td></tr>

		Due to the global pandemic there were no empty beds in any hospital and he was taken around in an ambulance for almost an entire day just looking for space in a hospital.

The parents went above and beyond to save their son but nothing could be done and they lost him to COVID.
