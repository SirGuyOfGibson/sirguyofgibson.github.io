I remember going back home for vacations and she would visit to say hi and check on me. She never asked for more, would come to my Mom asking for some of work to be done  when their family could not make ends meet and needed some money.
Her son grew up and was hired as a housekeeper and started supporting the family. He got married a few years back and has a 4-1/2 year old beauthiful daughter and his wife is pregnant again.
Their family was just seeing a ray of hope and Sumithra was finally hoping not having to do physical work anymore and spend time with her grandchildren..</span></p>

		<p><span style="font-size: 24px;">A few weeks back this dream came crashing down; her son who was at work was severely sick and was taken to the hospital from work. 
Here the doctors diagnosed him with COVID and transferred him to another hospital.
He was transferred to 3 hospitals, the aged parents had to ask around for immediate financial help to save their child. They incurred a debt of 8000$ ( they have no health insurance). The parents went above and beyond to save their son but nothing could be done and they lost him..The doctors say it was COVID, I cannot gurantee it, but all I know is no matter what the family still NEEDS HELP. The family lost their sole bread winner,  the aged parents are in no state to go work (even if they offer to work at 60-70 yrs nobody wants to hire them as their son had COVID and they could be infected) and the wife is pregnant. </span></p>
