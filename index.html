I remember going back home for vacations and she would visit to say hi and check on me. She was self reliant, hard working and always worked for her pay. When her family was struggling to make ends meet, she would look for extra work to support them without considering her age.
Her son grew up and was hired as a housekeeper and started supporting the family. He got married a few years back and has a 4-1/2 year old beautiful daughter and his wife is pregnant again.
Their family was just seeing a ray of hope and Sumithra was finally hoping not having to do physical work anymore and spend time with her grandchildren.</span></p>

		<p><span style="font-size: 34px;">Her son started feeling sick when at work and visited a local clinic nearby for the first 3 days. Here he was not treated well due which his condition abruptly worsened and had to be transferred to another hospital. 
Due to the global pandemic there were no empty beds in any hospital and he was taken around in an ambulance for almost an entire day just looking for space in a hospital.
He was then admitted in two hospitals before being shifted to "Sakra" hospital which is relatively expensive but there was no other choice. 
He was being treated there for about 15 days but the treatment was not successful and he succumbed to death. They incurred a debt of 8300$ ( they have no health insurance). The parents went above and beyond to save their son but nothing could be done and they lost him to COVID. The family lost their sole bread winner,  the aged parents are in no state to work and the wife is pregnant. </span></p>

The major monthly expenses are - rent(100$ for a 400 SqFt one bedroom house), parents medical bills (30$) and food (450$).
The family incurred a debt of 8300$ hoping to save Sumithra's son which now they have to pay back and have no means. The wife is pregnant and it will cost 2000$ to cover her medical bills when the baby is due.</span></p>
